# Unity-Obstacle-Course

I created this project as a part of Gamedev.tv's Complete C# Unity Game Developer 3D Online Course. 
In the first chapter of the course I learned the fundamentals of Unity3D and C#. Some of the concepts I learned about were:
-Start and Update methods
-SerializeField
-Materials
-Time.deltaTime
-Cinemachiene
-Basic Collision
-Rigidbody
-tags
-GetComponent
-Prefabs
-And lots more! 
I really enjoyed this project and chapter of Gamedev.tv's course!
